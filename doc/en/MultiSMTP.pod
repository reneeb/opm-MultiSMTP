=head1 NAME

MultiSMTP - make OTOBO aware of multiple SMTP servers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A standard OTOBO installation is not able to use different SMTP servers for each sender address. This can lead to problems as many recipient servers deny to deliver the mails as a reverse lookup does not respond the hostname of the sender address.

So each sender address needs its own SMTP server - and this is provided with this package.

After installation, there is a new item in the Email block in the admin area. That is to manage the address -> SMTP server mapping. You can configure the settings for each address given in the system addresses. And you can define the type of SMTP connection (plain SMTP, SMTPTLS or SMTP/S). The user's password can be stored in an encrypted way - if you want to use this feature, you have to install the Perl modules C<Crypt::CBC> and C<Crypt::DES>.

When a mail is sent, the package searches for the SMTP settings that belong to the sender address and if it can't find anything, it uses the SMTP settings from I<SysConfig> (that is used by the standard SMTP mechanism).
